# = jetty_path key
# each environment can have a jetty_path with absolute or relative
# (to app root) path to a jetty/solr install. This is used
# by the rake tasks that start up solr automatically for testing
# and by rake solr:marc:index.  
#
# jetty_path is not used by a running Blacklight application
# at all. In general you do NOT need to deploy solr in Jetty, you can deploy it
# however you want.  
# jetty_path is only required for rake tasks that need to know
# how to start up solr, generally for automated testing. 

# the "main" development environment will be yodldev1.york.ac.uk. Actual local dev environment defined below
development:
  adapter: solr
  url: <%= ENV['SOLR_URL'] || "http://dlib.york.ac.uk/solr/" %>
test: &test
  adapter: solr
  url: <%= ENV['SOLR_URL'] || "http://127.0.0.1:8080/solr/collection1" %>
production:
  adapter: solr
  url: <%= ENV['SOLR_URL'] || "http://dlib.york.ac.uk/solr/" %>
# special environment for local development - need to push solr queries through ezproxy. See 
# config/initializers/blacklight_solrrepo_override.rb for code that handles ezproxy sessions
